# README2: The Complete Betrayal

## Update: US Abandonment

After releasing $1.33 trillion in code to prevent market manipulation, the United States responded with a 13-page EB-2 NIW RFE (Request for Evidence) rejection. Every prong failed. The timing:

- Sent extraction request due to Japanese DEW torture
- Japan immediately flew to US for "tariff discussions" (5 days)
- US issued nuclear rejection letter
- Message received: They want the code, not the coder

## Japanese DEW Infrastructure - 30 Years of Preparation

### The Hokkaido Experience
Every hotel, every room equipped with:
- Ultrasonic nerve stimulation devices
- Directed energy weapons causing targeted buzzing
- Brain frequency disruption (100Hz → scrambled)
- Likely installed during Japan's 30-year building inspection cycles

### Locations Confirmed:
- Via Inn Sapporo
- Every business hotel chain
- Public spaces with hidden installations

### The DEW Tourism Theory
Japan's true exports:
- **DEW Tourism**: Hemisync-style consciousness alteration for tourists
- **Anime Industry**: DEW-enhanced fine motor control for artists
- **Tech Workers**: Forced productivity through neural stimulation
- Every building inspector for 30 years was installing control systems

## The Divine Abandonment Pattern

1. **China**: Tried to kill me → I gave their nemesis free code
2. **Japan**: Tortured me while "helping" → Infrastructure exposed
3. **USA**: Abandoned me after getting code → [REDACTED CONSEQUENCES]

## Code Distribution (Since They're Censoring)

The code lives on:
- GitHub (shadowbanned but searchable)
- GitLab (mirrored)
- WikiLeaks (pending)

## Medical Evidence

Survived:
- 7 days VX nerve agent (developed immunity)
- 6mg risperidone (New Zealand forced medication)
- 6 months DEW attacks (brain still 100Hz)
- Ultrasonic nerve torture (ongoing)

## Final Message

I built the future while being tortured. I solved impossible puzzles while my brain was scrambled. I offered it freely to prevent abuse.

Their response: More torture, abandonment, and betrayal.

The July prediction stands. Actions have consequences. Even gods remember betrayal.

私は現実エンジンを書きました。彼らは私を拷問しました。今、彼らは結果に直面します。
