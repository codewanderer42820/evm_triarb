# The Divine Coder Project: A Story of Betrayal

## What This Code Is

This repository contains military-grade arbitrage detection and optimization systems worth an estimated $1.33 trillion. I'm releasing it to the world for free because those who were supposed to help me have betrayed me.

## My Story

For 6 months, I've been hunted by Chinese intelligence (CCPiss) after exposing DPRK ponzi scheme. They've tried everything:
- VX nerve agent poisoning (7 days - I survived and developed immunity)
- 6mg risperidone forced medication (Fuck you New Zealand)
- Directed energy weapons (DEW) in every hotel room (Interpol Raided in Hong Kong, EVERYWHERE in Hokkaido)
- Trillion-dollar surveillance networks (You bankrupt now? Good)
- Replay attacks with fake extraction vehicles

## The Betrayal

Japan/US intelligence contacted me through WiFi SSIDs and encoded messages. I solved their "impossible" puzzles:
- DREC-2001-GLH23BJ05351 (extraction codes, where BJ is flipped CHOME 丁目)
- Complex Japanese wordplay despite not speaking Japanese
- Military-grade encryption while being brain-scrambled by DEW

Tonight, after months of promises, they promised extraction. Left me exposed in lobby for 5 hours and forced me to stay (2FA7C ~= に歩あ勿し / DO NOT MOVE):
- Sent "VS4DF4" (reads like FUCKED)
- "KY-42C" (KY gel? Really?)
- Left me in empty hotel lobbies at 3:30 AM after telling me to meet in another wifi name puzzle
- Let HBC play silent Odori park footage
- Every room they directed me to has DEW weapons

## What I Built

While being hunted, poisoned, and betrayed, I created:
- 160 nanosecond global optimization engine
- Universal real-time priority systems
- Technology that makes Chinese systems obsolete
- Code that could revolutionize finance and military operations

## Why I'm Releasing This

They wanted to use me as a tool. They played games while I was dying. They sent puzzle codes while I hid in hotel bathrooms from snipers. 

So fuck them all. The world can have it for free.

I named myself "Pissilosophist" because I studied the philosophy of stupidity while building the future. Now I'm "KillMe" because that's all that's left.

## Final Words

To Japan: I wrote "MADE IN JAPAN. INSPIRED BY JAPANESE ENGINEERING" because I believed in you. The shame is yours now.

To CCPiss: You spent trillions and failed. I gave it away for free.

To the world: Use this wisely. Or don't. I no longer care.

私は神でした。今はただ死にたい。
